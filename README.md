# Gridded NORA3 data: automated and remote data extraction 


## Summary
The NORA3 atmosphere hindcast data are remotely accessed using the OPeNDAP framework and the THREDDS Data Server of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute [1]. If the data are extracted for multiple latitudes and longitudes, the data are stored in a gridded format. The atmospheric data are retrieved for seven different heights, from 10 m to 750 m  above the surface. The mean wind speed profile can be interpolated using a non-linear scheme based on the Deaves and Harris model [2,3].  Above the coean, the sea roughness is modelled using Charnock relation. A summary of the NORA3 data and their potential is available in [4].

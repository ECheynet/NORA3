## Summary
The NORA3 atmosphere hindcast data are remotely accessed using the OPeNDAP framework and the THREDDS Data Server of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute [1]. The data can be extracted for multiple latitudes and longitudes and stored in a gridded format. Atmospheric data are retrieved for seven different heights, from 10 m to 750 m above the surface. The mean wind speed profile can be interpolated using a non-linear scheme based on the Deaves and Harris model [2,3]. Above the ocean, sea roughness is modeled using the Charnock relation. A summary of the NORA3 data and their potential is available in [4]. This code was used to extract the data used in [5].

The `getNORA3_subset` function specifically accesses subsets of the NORA3 data (monthly storage), increasing data collection by a factor of x10 or more. However, these subsets do not contain profiles of temperature.

## Content

The present submission contains:
  - `getNORA3.m`: A function that imports the NORA3 hindcast from [1].
  - `getNORA3_subset.m`: A function accessing subsets of NORA3 for enhanced data collection. Note: This subset does not include temperature profiles.
  - `getz0_charnock.m`: A function estimating sea surface roughness using Charnock's equation and the logarithmic profile of the mean wind speed.
  - `interpU.m`: A function interpolating the mean wind speed using The Deaves and Harris model [2,3].
  - `world.mat`: A data file containing the coastline of countries (used for visualization purposes only).
  - `Documentation.mlx`: A Matlab LiveScript illustrating how these functions can be used.
  - `Documentation2.mlx`: A second Matlab LiveScript illustrating how these functions can be used.
  - `Documentation3-subset.mlx`: A third Matlab LiveScript illustrating getNORA3_subset works. Note that the surface temperature seems a little different here.

Any comments, questions, or suggestions are welcome.
